# Multi-Agent AI Coding Assistant

This project implements a multi-agent AI system using LangChain to autonomously handle software development tasks. Given a high-level user requirement, a team of specialized AI agents collaborates to plan, write, review, and summarize a coding project.

## ✨ Features

- **Autonomous Code Generation:** Takes a natural language requirement and generates functional code.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Utilizes a team of specialized agents (Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Summarizer) for a robust workflow.
- **Iterative Development:** Includes a review and feedback loop to improve code quality automatically.
- **Dynamic Planning:** Generates a step-by-step development plan before writing any code.
- **Final Project Summary:** Concludes by providing the final code and a summary of the development process.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system is orchestrated by a central pipeline (`main_pipeline.py`) that manages the workflow between four distinct agents:

1.  **Planner Agent:** Receives the initial user requirement and breaks it down into a structured, phase-by-phase development plan.
2.  **Coding Agent:** Receives a specific phase objective from the plan and writes the corresponding code. It considers previously written code to maintain context.
3.  **Reviewer Agent:** Scrutinizes the code generated by the Coding Agent for bugs, errors, and alignment with the phase objectives. It can either approve the code or provide specific feedback for revision.
4.  **Summarizer Agent:** Once all phases are completed and approved, this agent creates a final summary of the project, detailing the development process and presenting the complete, final code.

The agents work in a sequence, with a crucial feedback loop between the Coding and Reviewer agents to ensure the code is correct before moving to the next phase.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- An API key from an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI Studio, etc.)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the source code):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Multi_Agent_Coding_project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is recommended. Based on the project, you would need libraries like `langchain`, `langchain-openai`, `python-dotenv`, etc.)*
    ```bash
    pip install langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your LLM API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    The application is configured to load this key from `utils/llm_config.py`.

### Usage

To run the multi-agent system, execute the main pipeline script from the root directory:

```bash
python main_pipeline.py
```

You will be prompted to enter your high-level project requirement. The agents will then take over and begin the development process, printing their progress to the console.
